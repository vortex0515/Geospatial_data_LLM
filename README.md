### Project Description

**Data Labeling Platform for Web3 Use Cases**

Developed a comprehensive data labeling platform designed to leverage Web3 technologies for various use cases. This platform facilitates crowdsourced tasks with crypto payments, ensuring efficient and secure processing of user-contributed data. Key components of the project include integration with Solana blockchain for handling payments, secure asset uploading on AWS S3, and implementing robust security measures for user-uploaded content.

**Key Features:**
- **Crowdsourced Tasks with Crypto Payments**: Users can complete tasks and receive payments in cryptocurrency, specifically using Solana for transaction handling.
- **Asset Uploading and Storage**: Utilized AWS S3 for asset storage, with pre-signed URLs to ensure secure uploads.
- **Web3 and Solana Integration**: Integrated Solana blockchain to manage payments and transactions, ensuring transparency and security.
- **Machine Learning Model Support**: Developed components to support machine learning models, enhancing the platform's data processing capabilities.
- **Security Considerations**: Implemented security measures to protect user data and manage private keys securely.
- **Database and Backend Design**: Designed a robust database schema and backend to handle task creation, worker management, and payment processing.
- **Frontend Development**: Created user-friendly frontend components to facilitate crypto transactions and user interactions.
